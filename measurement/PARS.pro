;Description
;-----------
;
;Defines five whole-kidney tissues:
;+ One representing normal kidneys using parameter values
;  measured in healthy volunteers [Sourbron et al Invest Radiol 2008].
;+ Four pathological kidneys taken from a
;  recent patient study on renal artery stenosis [Lim et al AJP 2013].
;  Patient cases were selected by identifying the kidneys
;  corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles in TE and VP
;All values are displayed in Table 1 [submitted paper]
;
;
;Syntax
;------
;
;parameters = PARS(tissue)
;
;
;Arguments
;---------
;
;tissue: number from 0 to 4 where
;   0 = Healthy volunteer
;   1 = Patient 1
;   2 = Patient 2
;   3 = Patient 3
;   4 = Patient 4
;
;Returns
;-------
;
;parameters
;    A 4-element array which contains
;    the values [FP, TP, PS, TE] for the required tissue
;
;
;Example
;-------
;
;Display the parameters of Patient 1:
;
;IDL> print, PARS(1)
